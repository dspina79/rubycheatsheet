# Ruby Cheat Sheet
This will cover the basics of ruby as well as some algorithms.
## Assignments and Output

```ruby
# This is a comment

# output a statement
# this will print out "Hello World to the console"
puts "Hello World"

# assignment to a property
name = "David"
puts "Hello, " + name
# ^^^ outputs "Hello, David"

# assign a string value and a number
person = "Dean"
age = 40

puts person
puts age

# ^^^ outputs "Dean" followed by "40", each on separate lines.

# assign an array
my_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
puts my_array # outputs each element in the array, one line each
```
## Loops

```ruby
# Loops and Iteration

# basic while loop
index = 1
while index < 10 do
    puts index
    index = index + 1
end
# ^^^ outputs the numbers 1 through 9
# each number on a separate line

# alternate to code above to run 9 times
9.times do |num|
    puts num
end
# ^^^ in the above case, it will print 0 through 8
# each number on a differnet line
 
# iterating over elements in an array
["Dave", "John", "Lisa", "Karen"].each do |name|
    puts name
end
# ^^^ outputs each name in the array on a different line
```
